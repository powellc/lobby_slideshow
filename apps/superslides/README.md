Django SuperSlides
===================

A simple django application that tracks a single set of slides and displays 
them using the Supersized! jQuery slideshow script.

Installation
--------------

  1. ``pip install django-superslides``
  2. Add 'superslides' to your INSTALLED_APPS variable in settings.py
  3. Hook up the app to your urls.
  4. ``python manage.py syncdb``

Usage
------

Superslides is not a fully featured slideshow "management" app. Rather, it 
displays a single big slideshow, in fullscreen mode, using Supersized!
